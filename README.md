# Project Description

This project is an examination of the language used in recipe instructions. I used Gensim and NLTK primarily to test if recipes could be classified by author using only the language of the instructional steps. 

# Data

The data was scraped with a custom spider from Allrecipes.com by me. I gathered 109 recipe texts from 10 different authors. 

# Results

The performance of the models I tested were quite close together, with all of them ranging from poor to fair. 

# Next Steps

I would like to take a larger sample of recipes and repeat this experiment and see if the performance improves with more data.
